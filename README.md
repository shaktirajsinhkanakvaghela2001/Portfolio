## Project Description
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic 1912 voyage. The analysis examines relationships between survival and variables like passenger class, gender, age, and fare.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about 891 passengers including:
- Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Name, Sex, Age
- Number of siblings/spouses/parents/children aboard
- Ticket information, Fare, Port of Embarkation

## Key Findings
1. **Overall Survival Rate**: Only 38.38% of passengers survived.
2. **Gender Impact**: 
   - Female survival rate: 74.20%
   - Male survival rate: 18.89%
3. **Class Disparity**:
   - 1st class: 62.96%
   - 2nd class: 47.28%
   - 3rd class: 24.24%
4. **Age Groups**:
   - Children had the highest survival rate at 54.17%
   - Seniors had the lowest at 22.22%

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical Operations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive Analysis)
